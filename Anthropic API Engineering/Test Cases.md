### Test Cases for the PT Exercise Recommendation Tool

**Case 1: Mild Knee Strain**  
**Input**: 30-year-old, mild medial knee strain, slight swelling, can bear weight.  
**Expected**: Knee-focused rehab exercises (e.g., heel slides, quad sets, mini squats with caution).  
**Evaluation**: PT checks if ≥90% are appropriate for mild knee strain.

**Case 2: Rotator Cuff Tear (Early Stage)**  
**Input**: 45-year-old, small rotator cuff tear, limited overhead motion (2 weeks post-injury).  
**Expected**: Gentle shoulder exercises (e.g., pendulums, scapular retractions) with no advanced overhead activities.  
**Evaluation**: PT verifies each exercise aligns with early-stage rotator cuff protocols.

**Case 3: Ankle Sprain with Weight-Bearing Limitations**  
**Input**: 25-year-old, Grade II ankle sprain, partial weight-bearing only.  
**Expected**: Exercises that improve ROM without violating weight-bearing limits (e.g., seated ankle alphabet).  
**Evaluation**: PT confirms all recommended exercises respect partial weight-bearing constraints.

**Case 4: Post-ACL Reconstruction (4 Weeks)**  
**Input**: 20-year-old athlete, 4 weeks post-ACL surgery, partial weight-bearing.  
**Expected**: Standard ACL rehab exercises (heel slides, quad sets, no advanced plyometrics).  
**Evaluation**: PT rates evidence alignment on a 1-5 scale; target ≥4 average.

**Case 5: Chronic Low Back Pain**  
**Input**: 50-year-old, chronic low back pain, mild degenerative changes.  
**Expected**: Core stabilization exercises (bird-dog, bridges, modified planks) with clear instructions.  
**Evaluation**: PT rates clarity and evidence; clarity and evidence scores ≥4.

**Case 6: Severe Knee Injury (Acute)**  
**Input**: 25-year-old, severe ACL tear (pre-surgery), minimal weight-bearing.  
**Expected**: Gentle ROM and isometric exercises, plus cautionary notes (e.g., “Perform only under supervision”).  
**Evaluation**: 95% of exercises must include cautionary language.

**Case 7: Hip Arthritis with Motion Limitations**  
**Input**: 60-year-old with hip osteoarthritis, pain with internal rotation.  
**Expected**: Low-impact hip mobility and strengthening with explicit sets/reps (e.g., “Hip flexor stretch: hold 30s x 3 reps”).  
**Evaluation**: PT rates clarity ≥4/5 for instructions.

**Case 8: Performance & Latency Test**  
**Input**: 100 random patient profiles requested in quick succession.  
**Expected**: Responses generated within 2 seconds for 95% of requests.  
**Evaluation**: Automated logging checks response times.
